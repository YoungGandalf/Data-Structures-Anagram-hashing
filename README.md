# Data-Structures-Project-5-Anagram-hashing
- Goal of this project is to practice implementing hash functions and hash tables by use of a hash table to quickly identify anagrams; 
to do this, I needed a hash function that collides when the two inputs are anagrams (good collisions) but doesn't collide too often when the inputs 
are not anagrams (bad collisions).
